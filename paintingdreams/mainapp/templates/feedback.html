      <p>Dear Wendy</p>
      <p>Just to thank you for the beautiful inspirations you share with us. This picture is in my sanctuary or sacred space. It's actually a BBQ hut, but with a solar pipe instead of the grill. I have 5 of your hangings , one in each of the quarters, plus the crone. I also have some of your prints there, Nuit, Sige and Andraste. This is my place of worship, contemplation and workings. The shape of the hut with your beautiful designs support me and provide me with everything I need. The hut was a gift to me on my retirement , I know I am so very lucky. The picture doesn't do justice to your work, but I hope it reflects how much it is loved and valued. Thank you.</p>

      <p>I just want to take a moment to send you my heart-felt THANKS for a signed copy of your amazing Luna Moon Hare book. It arrived safe and sound along with the beautiful yule card set a few days after you had dispatched it.</p>

      <p>My copy of Luna Moon Hare arrived today. Thank you for despatching it so promptly.</p>
      <p>Although I have seen reviews of the book and examples of your wonderful artwork, I am absolutely enchanted by this book.  The way the story journeys through the season is just perfect and the art is entrancing.  I am so looking forward to sharing it with my granddaughter when she is a little older but, in the meantime, I intend to guard jealously and read it often!</p>

      <p>A spectacular Calendar with the most exquisite artwork.</p>
      <p>It has everything in it that a Pagan could wish for. It gives you all the main Festivals of the year and also the phases of the Moon.</p>
      <p>At the end of each page/month, there is a little paragraph giving you a mantra for the month. It is nice to be able to buy British Calendars for Pagans.'</p>

      <p>Hello Wendy,</p>
      <p>That delivery was amazingly fast. I had the book and card the next day!</p>
      <p>The particular painting of 'The Lord of the Wildwood' is my favourite portrayal of the god in any form. You have captured so many elements of him; strong, protective, caring and nurturing. and rather 'other' than a muscly human. I had one of these before but gave it to my niece to put on her altar. I think we shall both want the wall-hanging eventually.</p>
      <p>The book is stunning. The story is a joy to read. Excellent for children, but also to meditate onl. I am particularly fond of your line ...'She stretches out her arm and makes it a path to forever...' The illustrations, of course, all all evocative of the Goddess and the turning of the year. My particular favourite is Imbolc, with the glorious Brigid.</p>
      <p>As you can tell, I am very pleased with my purchase.</p>
      <p>Long may you brighten the world and inform others about the Goddess with your works of art.</p>
      <p>Blessings</p>

Your work brings out a deep rooted emotion, a connection to Mother Earth that I sometimes feel I have not lost but miss in the hectic day to day routine of everyday life. Giving these cards to others I hope will share this connection and they will look upon them and feel the love and beauty in your work.</p>

      <p>My copy of Luna Moon Hare arrived this morning. It is a most beautiful book, which made me cry when I looked through it. The images are wonderful. Thank you. I learned about you when a friend gave me a Yule card, which I still have on display because I love it too much to put it away. Then I decided to buy some cards, but couldn't make up my mind which.

      <p>Thank you too for the hand written card, that personal touch is and was much appreciated. I was not expecting the Luna Moon Hare book to be signed, as again, thank you for such a personal touch. This is the second copy I have bought, the first was for my niece, and I loved it so much that I had to get another one for myself.</p>
      <p>The print of Luna with the swan is even more lovely than the image in the book, if that's possible, and I look forward to getting it framed and hung at the earliest opportunity.</p>
      <p>I look forward to having some time later to listen to the CD and I hope that the Yule Hugs cards will result in smiles on the recipients' faces at Christmas. I have no doubt that I'll be back for more cards throughout the year - so I look forward to speaking to you in the future.</p>

      <p>Hello Wendy,</p>
      <p>Having ordered a copy of the "Sacred Pouch" CD as soon as you announced it was available, and receiving it so swiftly, i wanted to send you my heartfelt thanks for a truly uplifting experience when i sat down to listen to it for the first time last night.</p>

My hope is that over time i can collect all of the wall hangings to create a sanctuary of peace at my home. They are inspirational. Many thanks and all the best for 2012.</p>

      <p>Hello Wendy,</p>
      <p>I just wanted to let you know that the prints arrived safe and sound today and I am so pleased with them. For a long, long time I've been looking for, what for me, would be the perfect representation of the Horned God. Thanks to you, I've finally found him !!! Thank you so very, very much.</p>
      <p>Also, another big thank you for your amazing book Luna Moon Hare. It's one of my most treasured books ever. I never thought I'd one day actually get the opportunity to tell you just how much I love it. There are no words to describe how moving and beautiful it is.</p>
      <p>Now I've found your website I shall be a frequent visitor.</p>
      <p>Again, thank you so much.</p>
      <p>Love, Peace &amp; Blessed Be</p>

      <p>Hi Wendy</p>
      <p>I have just received my copy of your new 'Goddess Calendar'. I was thrilled it is as beautiful as I expected it would be. As the proud owner of 'Luna Moon Hare' I had high expectations and was not disappointed. I am so drawn to the beauty of your paintings they have an ethereal quality and I am mesmerized every time I look at them. They take you in and lead you on a journey to your inner self. Pure meditation in a picture. Really I don't have the words to fully describe how they make me feel but the closest I can come to it is that they fill me with wonder. Never stop painting it is part of your soul and journey and gives more pleasure than you will ever know.</p>
      <p>My personal favourite is Hare Dreaming (I love your depiction of beautiful Hare) closely followed by Gaia's Winter Rest but of course they are all so beautiful!</p>
      <p>Blessings</p>

      <p>Dear Wendy,</p>
      <p>Thank you so much for the Goddess Wheel (of the year, of life). It is such a wonderful idea, and the art work is beautiful. My wife loves it and could not image anything better. Moreover, my wife said the painting of Bridget was the best image ever that she has seen.</p>
      <p>Also, you packed the Wheel in a secure way, and it arrived here in perfect shape. I appreciate that.</p>
      <p>And also, another 'also', you included such a lovely card, with your thanks and blessings. How thoughtful.</p>
      <p>We are so pleased and happy with your work.</p>
      <p>I suspect we will give another look at your web site.</p>

      <p>Hi Wendy</p>
      <p>'Luna Moon Hare' is both Wonderfully inspired and beautifully crafted...A truly Magical Journey through the Seasons Thank you for sharing your Gift with the World.</p>
      <p>I look forward to reading this book to my Grandson when he is a little older, it is so important that these old wisdoms are passed down to future generations and the symbolism in your paintings speak volumes that words alone can only struggle to convey. I do hope that you are inspired to produce more books like this in the future, as this gifted combination of words and art work not only provide much pleasure (your cards also!) they help to Awaken the true Spirit of both this Beautiful Land and it's inhabitants.</p>
      <p>Blessed Be<br>Pam</p>

      <p>Hello Wendy,</p>
      <p>I received the wall hanging and the pictures yesterday. I just wanted to say how pleased I am with them. The wall hanging is absolutely gorgeous and is now proudly hanging on my bedroom door. The pictures are so beautiful and I intend to put them into frames and hang them round the house. I love your art work so much and it incorporates everything that I love about nature, animals and the goddess. Both my daughters, aged 5 and 1 love your work also and we've been studying your wall hanging and deciding between us which bit we like the best!</p>
      <p>Thanks again<br>Catherine x</p>

      <p>Hi Wendy, thank you for the quickness of your service. We received the book and cards yesterday and also your personally written card.</p>
      <p>They are all beautiful, the cards, the book and everything.</p>
      <p>Im finding it hard to describe how emotional it has made me in a good way though! The book is perfect for teaching my 6 year old the turning of the wheel and how the seasons and the earth work together and how the hare is the perfect medium to be understood by all ages.</p>
      <p>Again, thank you and I'm sure I'll be back for more and will definitely recommend it to others in our group whom have children the same age as mine Im sure they will love it too.</p>
      <p>Bright Blessings</p>

      <p>(I love the Luna Moon Hare book - I use it as a display, sitting atop an old pine Kist, turning the pages to follow the seasons. It looks great beside a huge display of Tansy and Acer leaves just now...)</p>

      <p>The print I ordered from you just two days ago has just arrived. I'm still tingling with the emotions that your paintings evoke in me.</p>
      <p>As with Morgan Le Fay (who has been on my wall since the beginning of August), Merlin has now taken up residence, too.</p>
      <p>I can't begin to tell you how excited and surprised I was when the postman handed it to me just now. Thank you so much for getting it to me so quickly.</p>
      <p>I'm thrilled with it, as I knew I would be. Thank you, also, for the beautiful cards (and note) that you sent with the picture.</p>
      <p>They will also be framed and positioned around my home, to further bring the magic alive in this house - although, it is ever-present in my heart.</p>
      <p>I shall visit your website again very soon and I know I shall not be able to resist placing another order! Until then, love and blessings,</p>>

      <p>Just to let you know that all of them arrived in perfect condition! You had packed them so caringly that not even the Spanish postmen could harm them!</p>
      <p>Thanks so much for all the wonderful postcards you sent me too! I love them all! Your artwork is of breath-taking beauty and spreading such a beautiful energy! One can feel their strong presence shifting the energy of any room immediately when hung on the wall.</p>
