          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Hello Wendy!</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">I just want to take a moment to send you my heart-felt THANKS for a signed copy of your amazing Luna Moon Hare book. It arrived safe and sound along with the beautiful yule card set a few days after you had dispatched it.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">While I find the cards truly amazing, I think the book is pure magic! I read it in one take after a particularly exhausting day, and it brought me right back to earth with its wonderful imagery and beautiful story-telling.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Thank you once again, and keep up the good work :)</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Bright blessings and a merry Beltane to you,</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Hi Wendy</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">My copy of Luna Moon Hare arrived today. Thank you for despatching it so promptly.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Although I have seen reviews of the book and examples of your wonderful artwork, I am absolutely enchanted by this book.  The way the story journeys through the season is just perfect and the art is entrancing.  I am so looking forward to sharing it with my granddaughter when she is a little older but, in the meantime, I intend to guard jealously and read it often!</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Thank you so much for bringing such a lovely work into being</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Bright Blessings</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">A spectacular Calendar with the most exquisite artwork.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">It has everything in it that a Pagan could wish for. It gives you all the main Festivals of the year and also the phases of the Moon.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">At the end of each page/month, there is a little paragraph giving you a mantra for the month. It is nice to be able to buy British Calendars for Pagans.'</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">I received my cards yesterday (super quick),many thanks for that!</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">I have got to say that your paintings are absolutely beautiful, even more so in real life, I absolutely love British wildlife and feel all our animals are much maligned and persecuted and you have such empathy with these beautiful creatures, they deserve so much more and it really shows in your lovely paintings, I will treasure them, and be very proud to buy some lovely frames to hang them in.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">I look forward to seeing more of your beautiful artwork in the future</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Thank you </p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Everything is arrived. Oh Wendy, I have no words to explain how I am impressed by your art.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Your new paintings are fantastic, and the calendar...</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">I don't know what magic you do, but it's like you can reach exactly what I feel and give it shapes and colours.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Me and Matti are so moved...it's fantastic...</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Just in case...do you have any of the original available of your new paintings? Of the calendar or any other?</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">I just wanted to drop you a line to say thank you for our beautiful wall hanging. It is the first thing I gaze upon in the mornings which is very grounding before I shoot off into the crazy world. It has given us so much enjoyment and I just wanted to let you know how much your work is admired.</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Hello Wendy,</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">That delivery was amazingly fast. I had the book and card the next day!</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">The particular painting of 'The Lord of the Wildwood' is my favourite portrayal of the god in any form. You have captured so many elements of him; strong, protective, caring and nurturing. and rather 'other' than a muscly human. I had one of these before but gave it to my niece to put on her altar. I think we shall both want the wall-hanging eventually.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">The book is stunning. The story is a joy to read. Excellent for children, but also to meditate onl. I am particularly fond of your line ...'She stretches out her arm and makes it a path to forever...' The illustrations, of course, all all evocative of the Goddess and the turning of the year. My particular favourite is Imbolc, with the glorious Brigid.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">As you can tell, I am very pleased with my purchase.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Long may you brighten the world and inform others about the Goddess with your works of art.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Blessings</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Dear Wendy,<br>Thank you so much for the fast delivery of the book, this one is a gift for someone and I hope she loves it as much as I love my own copy. Your book is so beautiful, both the pictures and the words, I found it so reassuring during a difficult time. Wishing you a wonderful and creative 2014, thank you again for your magical book.<br>With very best wishes, Sarah.</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Dear Wendy,</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Thankyou so much for sending me the cards so quickly. They are absolutely stunning and I know the friends and family who will receive them be enchanted by their ethereal beauty, as was I. Your work brings out a deep rooted emotion, a connection to Mother Earth that I sometimes feel I have not lost but miss in the hectic day to day routine of everyday life. Giving these cards to others I hope will share this connection and they will look upon them and feel the love and beauty in your work.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Again, many thanks,</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">I apologise for not having sent this sooner but time seems to have evaporated. I just wanted to say thank you so much for getting my order out so quickly. I received it within 24 hours which was lovely. Everything was in top shape and the calendars are so beautiful as there is so much to see in them.  I may have great difficulty parting with some of them for Christmas presents! So once again thank you.</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">What a lovely start to the day! I received your beautiful Folk Art Goddess cards this morning! Many thanks! I absolutely love them and will be framing them to take pride of place over my altar! Such wonderful detail, design and colours - perfect visual aids to connect with, and meditate on, each Goddess. Thank you also for the gorgeous swan and hare card too - such a nice touch. x</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">I just wanted to thank-you for sending the wall hangings so quickly after you returned from your holiday - they arrived safely and the packaging was superb. Thank-you also for the lovely card that you sent too - it was very much appreciated. The Goddess wall hangings are really beautiful and I'm amazed at the detail contained within each one of them. They each capture the energy and the sacredness of the Goddess in their own unique way.</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Hi Wendy,</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">My copy of Luna Moon Hare arrived this morning. It is a most beautiful book, which made me cry when I looked through it. The images are wonderful. Thank you. I learned about you when a friend gave me a Yule card, which I still have on display because I love it too much to put it away. Then I decided to buy some cards, but couldn't make up my mind which. The book will keep me happy.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Love and thanks for your great gift<br>Pat</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Dear Wendy,</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">I just wanted to say thank you so much for my package, which arrived this morning as promised. Everything was so well wrapped and arrived safely.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Thank you too for the hand written card, that personal touch is and was much appreciated. I was not expecting the Luna Moon Hare book to be signed, as again, thank you for such a personal touch. This is the second copy I have bought, the first was for my niece, and I loved it so much that I had to get another one for myself.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">The print of Luna with the swan is even more lovely than the image in the book, if that's possible, and I look forward to getting it framed and hung at the earliest opportunity.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">I look forward to having some time later to listen to the CD and I hope that the Yule Hugs cards will result in smiles on the recipients' faces at Christmas. I have no doubt that I'll be back for more cards throughout the year - so I look forward to speaking to you in the future.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">With kind regards and best wishes</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Hello Wendy,</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Having ordered a copy of the "Sacred Pouch" CD as soon as you announced it was available, and receiving it so swiftly, i wanted to send you my heartfelt thanks for a truly uplifting experience when i sat down to listen to it for the first time last night.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">From the outset, with the exquisite intermingling of voice and music, i was drawn into the magic of past, present &amp; future so smoothly and easily, and able to immediately enter the flow of images evoked by your word-pictures. The ensuing visual and spiritual journey led to an extraordinarily mystical encounter, and one which i may return to and re-enter at any time or season, when in need of inner refreshment and healing.<br>Thank you.</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">just wanted to say a big thank you for the beautiful Fire goddess hanging. it is truly stunning.  I am amazed at how quickly it came!! I purchased the Sacred creatures calender whilst i was in Glastonbury and was thrilled to see you have a website.  You are a very talented lady.  My hope is that over time i can collect all of the wall hangings to create a sanctuary of peace at my home.  They are inspirational. Many thanks and all the best for 2012.</p>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Hi Wendy</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">I have just received my copy of your new 'Goddess Calendar'. I was thrilled it is as beautiful as I expected it would be. As the proud owner of 'Luna Moon Hare' I had high expectations and was not disappointed. I am so drawn to the beauty of your paintings they have an ethereal quality and I am mesmerized every time I look at them. They take you in and lead you on a journey to your inner self. Pure meditation in a picture. Really I don't have the words to fully describe how they make me feel but the closest I can come to it is that they fill me with wonder. Never stop painting it is part of your soul and journey and gives more pleasure than you will ever know.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">My personal favourite is Hare Dreaming (I love your depiction of beautiful Hare) closely followed by Gaia's Winter Rest but of course they are all so beautiful!</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Blessings</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Dear Wendy,</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Thank you so much for the Goddess Wheel (of the year, of life). It is such a wonderful idea, and the art work is beautiful. My wife loves it and could not image anything better. Moreover, my wife said the painting of Bridget was the best image ever that she has seen.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Also, you packed the Wheel in a secure way, and it arrived here in perfect shape. I appreciate that.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">And also, another 'also', you included such a lovely card, with your thanks and blessings. How thoughtful.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">We are so pleased and happy with your work.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">I suspect we will give another look at your web site.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Kind Regards,<br>Mark &amp; Iris, USA</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">'Luna Moon Hare' is�both Wonderfully inspired�and beautifully�crafted...A truly Magical Journey through the Seasons Thank you for sharing your Gift with the World.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">I look forward to reading this book to my Grandson when he is a little older, it is so important that these old wisdoms are passed down to future generations and the symbolism in your paintings speak volumes that words alone can only struggle to convey.� I do hope that you are inspired to produce more books like this in the future, as this gifted combination of words and art work�not only provide much pleasure (your cards also!) they help to Awaken the true Spirit of both this Beautiful Land and it's inhabitants.</p>

            <p>Hello Wendy,</p>
            <p>I received the wall hanging and the pictures yesterday. I just wanted to say how pleased I am with them. The wall hanging is absolutely gorgeous and is now proudly hanging on my bedroom door. The pictures are so beautiful and I intend to put them into frames and hang them round the house. I love your art work so much and it incorporates everything that I love about nature, animals and the goddess. Both my daughters, aged 5 and 1 love your work also and we've been studying your wall hanging and deciding between us which bit we like the best!</p>
            <p>Thanks again<br>Catherine x</p>

          <p>Hi Wendy, thank you for the quickness of your service. We received the book and cards yesterday and also your personally written card.<br><br>They are all beautiful, the cards, the book and everything.<br><br>Im finding it hard to describe how emotional it has made me in a good way though! The book is perfect for teaching my 6 year old the turning of the wheel and how the seasons and the earth work together and how the hare is the perfect medium to be understood by all ages.<br><br>Again, thank you and I'm sure I'll be back for more and will definitely recommend it to others in our group whom have children the same age as mine Im sure they will love it too.<br><br>Bright Blessings<br><br>Sharon xx<br><br>Keep doing what your doing because its working!</p>

          <p>Hello Wendy,<br><br>I just wanted to thank you for the totally gorgeous Luna Moon Hare Calendar, which arrived safely yesterday. I can’t wait till January to be able to hang it up!<br><br>(I love the Luna Moon Hare book - I use it as a display, sitting atop an old pine Kist, turning the pages to follow the seasons. It looks great beside a huge display of Tansy and Acer leaves just now...)<br><br>With love &amp; blessings xx<br><br>Kind Regards<br>Kate</p>

            Hi Wendy<br>
            <br>
            The print I ordered from you just two days ago has just arrived. I'm still tingling with the emotions that your paintings evoke in me.
            As with Morgan Le Fay (who has been on my wall since the beginning of August), Merlin has now taken up residence, too.
            I can't begin to tell you how excited and surprised I was when the postman handed it to me just now. Thank you so much for getting it to me so quickly.
            I'm thrilled with it, as I knew I would be. Thank you, also, for the beautiful cards (and note) that you sent with the picture.
            They will also be framed and positioned around my home, to further bring the magic alive in this house - although, it is ever-present in my heart.
            I shall visit your website again very soon and I know I shall not be able to resist placing another order! Until then, love and blessings,<br>
            <br>

            Hi Wendy<br>
            <br>
            This order will complete my wheel of the year collection and I just wanted to let you know how much I enjoy your work. Your paintings hang above my altar, each one in turn as the seasons change, Hecate�s still there at the moment.
            I also wanted to thank you for your prompt service and friendly notes, its so unusual in this busy age.<br>
            Thanks again and Blessed Be<br>

            Dearest Wendy<br>
            <br>
            Some weeks ago I got the four paintings I had ordered at your website.<br>
            Just to let you know that all of them arrived in perfect condition! You had packed them so caringly that not even the Spanish postmen could harm them!<br>
            Thanks so much for all the wonderful postcards you sent me too! I love them all! Your artwork is of breath-taking beauty and spreading such a beautiful energy! One can feel their strong presence shifting the energy of any room immediately when hung on the wall.<br>
            Wishing you the very best!<br>
            <br>
            Lots of love Renate (Spain)
